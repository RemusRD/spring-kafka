== Sample 4

This sample uses a custom kafka serializer and deserializer in order to consume and send events using the jdk8 LocalDatetime
and Kotlin data classes.

You can do POST's and GET's from the localhost:8080/notes endpoint, there is a sample request at http with a valid body for
the POST operation.

The POST's will send a kafka message to the "notes" topic, it is not consumed by this application but it could be consumed
easily with the deserializer configuration in the KafkaConfig class.
