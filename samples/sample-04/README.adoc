== Sample 4

This sample uses a custom kafka serializer and deserializer in order to consume and send events using the jdk8 Date classes and Kotlin data classes.

Docker containers needed are in `samples/sample-04/docker`.

You can do POST's and GET's to the `localhost:8080/notes endpoint.`

There is a sample request at http with a valid body for the POST operation.

The POST's will send a kafka message to the "notes" topic.

It is not consumed by this application but it could be consumed easily with the deserializer configuration in the KafkaConfig class.
